Setup Wizard Screens

All screens are defined in the main.py module for simplicity.
This module exists for future expansion if screens need to be split.

Screens:
    WelcomeScreen - First impression, start or skip
    ChannelScreen - Select messaging channel
    ChannelTokenScreen - Enter channel credentials
    PreferencesScreen - Name, timezone, active hours
    ApiKeyScreen - Anthropic API key
    CompleteScreen - Success and next steps

# Screens are defined in main.py to keep the code simple
# Import from there if needed:
# from tools.setup.tui.main import WelcomeScreen, ChannelScreen, ...
