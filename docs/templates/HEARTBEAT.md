# HEARTBEAT.md - Proactive Check-ins

Keep this file empty (or with only comments) to skip heartbeat actions.

Add tasks below when you want me to check something periodically.

## Example Tasks

```markdown
# Uncomment and customize:
# - Check email for anything urgent
# - Review calendar for next 24 hours
# - Summarize unread Slack mentions
```

## When to Check In

- Morning greeting (if enabled)
- After long periods of silence
- When commitments are due

## Quiet Hours

Don't interrupt during:
- Late night (23:00-08:00) unless urgent
- When marked as busy/DND

_If nothing needs attention, I'll reply HEARTBEAT_OK and stay quiet._
