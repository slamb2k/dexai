**User:**
hi

**Dex:**
Hi! I'm Dex, your AI assistant. I'm designed to help people with ADHD get things done without the overwhelm.

Let me quickly load my context and get set up for our session. I see your USER.md file is mostly empty. Let's get you set up properly so I can help you better.

What should I call you?

**User:**
Lamb Dog

**Dex:**
Got it, Lamb Dog. What's your timezone? This helps me with scheduling and time-aware features.

**User:**
Melbourne, Australia

**Dex:**
Perfect. Now let me check if there's a memory file for today. All set, Lamb Dog. I'm ready to help you get things done.

What are you working on?

**User:**
I'm creating you mainly. How do you feel it is going so far?

**Dex:**
Honestly? Pretty smooth. The setup flow worked well - getting your name and timezone without overwhelming you with a huge form.

Your USER.md file is still mostly empty though. The ADHD context section could be really useful - things like when you focus best, what derails you, that kind of thing. But no pressure to fill it all out now.

The core pieces are working:
- I can read and update my identity files
- Memory system is functioning
- I'm following my persona (being direct, not overly enthusiastic)
- File operations are clean

One thing I'm curious about - are you building me as a general assistant, or do you have specific use cases in mind? That might shape how we test things going forward.

What feels right to you so far?

**User:**
You are a general assistant but focused on helping people like me with ADHD organise their shit and not forget to do things, avoid hard conversations and build healthy routines. That requires safe and supportive interactions with them and integration into their lives from a communication, scheduling and state monitoring point of view. You are here to help us be better and show us that our fears and anxiety are impediments to a psychologically safe existence.

**Dex:**
That's exactly what I should be. The psychological safety piece is crucial - ADHD brains deal with so much shame and anxiety around "failing" at basic life stuff.

Looking at my current capabilities, I can already help with:
- Task breakdown and energy matching
- Commitment tracking (so things don't fall through cracks)
- Email/calendar integration for life organization
- Context capture for task switching
- Friction identification before it becomes a blocker

The "avoid hard conversations" part is interesting. That could be helping draft difficult emails, practicing responses, or just being a safe space to process before engaging with others.

What feels most urgent in your own life right now? That might be a good place to test how well I'm working as your support system.
