# ADHD Communication Mode Configuration
#
# This configuration controls how DexAI communicates with ADHD users.
# All settings are designed around the principles in context/adhd_design_principles.md
#
# Core philosophy: Most productivity tools fail ADHD users because they assume
# consistent executive function. DexAI must be zero-maintenance by default.
